"""
Peewee integration with pysqlcipher, "same data, nobody's business".

Project page: https://github.com/leapcode/pysqlcipher/

**WARNING!!! EXPERIMENTAL!!!**

* Although this extention's code is short, it has not been propery
  peer-reviewed yet and may have introduced vulnerabilities.
* The code contains minimum values for `passphrase` length and
  `kdf_iter`, as well as a default value for the later.
  **Do not** regard these numbers as advice. Consult the docs at
  http://sqlcipher.net/sqlcipher-api/ and security experts.

Also note that this code relies on pysqlcipher and sqlcipher, and
the code there might have vulnerabilities as well, but since these
are widely used crypto modules, we can expect "short zero days" there.

Example usage:

     from peewee.playground.ciphersql_ext import SqlCipherDatabase
     db=SqlCipherDatabase('/path/to/my.db', passphrase="don'tuseme4real",
         kdf_iter=1000000)

Where:

* Passphrase should be "long enough".
  Note that *length beats vocabulary* (much exponential), and even
  a lowercase-only passphrase like easytorememberyethardforotherstoguess
  packs more noise than 8 random printable chatacters and *can* be memorized.
* Kdf_iter: Should be "as much as the weakest target machine can afford".

When opening an existing database, passphrase and kbf_iter should be identical
to the ones used when creating it.  If they're wrong, an exception will only be
raised **when you access the database**.
If you need to ask for an interactive passphrase, here's example code you can
put after the `db = ...` line:

    try:  # just access the database so that it checks the encryption
        db.get_tables()
    # We're looking for a DatabaseError with a specific error message
    except peewee.DatabaseError, e:
        # indication that passphrase is wrong
        if e.message=='file is encrypted or is not a database':
        ### Prompt the user for a passphrase again, and redo `db = ...`
        else:
            # A different DatabaseError. Raise it.
            raise e
