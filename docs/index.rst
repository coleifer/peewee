Note
----

Hi, I'm Charlie the author of peewee.  I hope that you enjoy using this library
as much as I've enjoyed writing it.  Peewee wouldn't be anywhere near as useful
without people like you, so thank you.  If you find any bugs, odd behavior, or
have an idea for a new feature please don't hesitate to `open an issue <https://github.com/coleifer/peewee/issues?state=open>`_ on GitHub.
