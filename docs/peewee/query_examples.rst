Query Examples
==============

These query examples are taken from the site `PostgreSQL Exercises
<https://pgexercises.com/>`_. A sample data-set can be found on the `getting
started page <https://pgexercises.com/gettingstarted.html>`_.

Here is a visual representation of the schema used in these examples:

.. image:: schema-horizontal.png

Model Definitions
-----------------

To begin working with the data, we'll define the model classes that correspond
to the tables in the diagram.

.. note::
    In some cases we explicitly specify column names for a particular field.
    This is so our models are compatible with the database schema used for the
    postgres exercises.

.. code-block:: python

    from functools import partial
    from peewee import *


    db = PostgresqlDatabase('peewee_test')

    class BaseModel(Model):
        class Meta:
            database = db

    class Member(BaseModel):
        memid = AutoField()  # Auto-incrementing primary key.
        surname = CharField()
        firstname = CharField()
        address = CharField(max_length=300)
        zipcode = IntegerField()
        telephone = CharField()
        recommendedby = ForeignKeyField('self', backref='recommended',
                                        column_name='recommendedby', null=True)
        joindate = DateTimeField()

        class Meta:
            table_name = 'members'


    # Conveniently declare decimal fields suitable for storing currency.
    MoneyField = partial(DecimalField, decimal_places=2)


    class Facility(BaseModel):
        facid = AutoField()
        name = CharField()
        membercost = MoneyField()
        guestcost = MoneyField()
        initialoutlay = MoneyField()
        monthlymaintenance = MoneyField()

        class Meta:
            table_name = 'facilities'


    class Booking(BaseModel):
        bookid = AutoField()
        facility = ForeignKeyField(Facility, column_name='facid')
        member = ForeignKeyField(Member, column_name='memid')
        starttime = DateTimeField()
        slots = IntegerField()

        class Meta:
            table_name = 'bookings'


Schema Creation
---------------

If you downloaded the SQL file from the PostgreSQL Exercises site, then you can
load the data into a PostgreSQL database using the following commands::

    createdb peewee_test
    psql -U postgres -f clubdata.sql -d peewee_test -x -q

To create the schema using Peewee, without loading the sample data, you can run
the following:

.. code-block:: python

    # Assumes you have created the database "peewee_test" already.
    db.create_tables([Member, Facility, Booking])


Basic Exercises
---------------

This category deals with the basics of SQL. It covers select and where clauses,
case expressions, unions, and a few other odds and ends.

Retrieve everything
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Retrieve all information from facilities table.

.. code-block:: sql

    SELECT * FROM facilities

.. code-block:: python

    # By default, when no fields are explicitly passed to select(), all fields
    # will be selected.
    query = Facility.select()

Retrieve specific columns from a table
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Retrieve names of facilities and cost to members.

.. code-block:: sql

    SELECT name, membercost FROM facilities;

.. code-block:: python

    query = Facility.select(Facility.name, Facility.membercost)

    # To iterate:
    for facility in query:
        print(facility.name)

Control which rows are retrieved
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Retrieve list of facilities that have a cost to members.

.. code-block:: sql

    SELECT * FROM facilities WHERE membercost > 0

.. code-block:: python

    query = Facility.select().where(Facility.membercost > 0)

Control which rows are retrieved - part 2
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Retrieve list of facilities that have a cost to members, and that fee is less
than 1/50th of the monthly maintenance cost. Return id, name, cost and
monthly-maintenance.

.. code-block:: sql

    SELECT facid, name, membercost, monthlymaintenance
    FROM facilities
    WHERE membercost > 0 AND membercost < (monthlymaintenance / 50)

.. code-block:: python

    query = (Facility
             .select(Facility.facid, Facility.name, Facility.membercost,
                     Facility.monthlymaintenance)
             .where(
                 (Facility.membercost > 0) &
                 (Facility.membercost < (Facility.monthlymaintenance / 50))))

Basic string searches
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

How can you produce a list of all facilities with the word 'Tennis' in their
name?

.. code-block:: sql

    SELECT * FROM facilities WHERE name ILIKE '%tennis%';

.. code-block:: python

    query = Facility.select().where(Facility.name.contains('tennis'))

    # OR use the exponent operator. Note: you must include wildcards here:
    query = Facility.select().where(Facility.name ** '%tennis%')


Matching against multiple possible values
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

How can you retrieve the details of facilities with ID 1 and 5? Try to do it
without using the OR operator.

.. code-block:: sql

    SELECT * FROM facilities WHERE facid IN (1, 5);

.. code-block:: python

    query = Facility.select().where(Facility.facid.in_([1, 5]))

    # OR:
    query = Facility.select().where((Facility.facid == 1) |
                                    (Facility.facid == 5))

Classify results into buckets
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

How can you produce a list of facilities, with each labelled as 'cheap' or
'expensive' depending on if their monthly maintenance cost is more than $100?
Return the name and monthly maintenance of the facilities in question.

.. code-block:: sql

    SELECT name,
    CASE WHEN monthlymaintenance > 100 THEN 'expensive' ELSE 'cheap' END
    FROM facilities;

.. code-block:: python

    cost = Case(None, [(Facility.monthlymaintenance > 100, 'expensive')], 'cheap')
    query = Facility.select(Facility.name, cost.alias('cost'))

.. note:: See documentation :py:class:`Case` for more examples.


Working with dates
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

How can you produce a list of members who joined after the start of September
2012? Return the memid, surname, firstname, and joindate of the members in
question.

.. code-block:: sql

    SELECT memid, surname, firstname, joindate FROM members
    WHERE joindate >= '2012-09-01';

.. code-block:: python

    query = (Member
             .select(Member.memid, Member.surname, Member.firstname, Member.joindate)
             .where(Member.joindate >= datetime.date(2012, 9, 1)))


Removing duplicates, and ordering results
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

How can you produce an ordered list of the first 10 surnames in the members
table? The list must not contain duplicates.

.. code-block:: sql

    SELECT DISTINCT surname FROM members ORDER BY surname LIMIT 10;

.. code-block:: python

    query = (Member
             .select(Member.surname)
             .order_by(Member.surname)
             .limit(10)
             .distinct())


Combining results from multiple queries
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You, for some reason, want a combined list of all surnames and all facility
names.

.. code-block:: sql

    SELECT surname FROM members UNION SELECT name FROM facilities;

.. code-block:: python

    lhs = Member.select(Member.surname)
    rhs = Facility.select(Facility.name)
    query = lhs | rhs

Queries can be composed using the following operators:

* ``|`` - ``UNION``
* ``+`` - ``UNION ALL``
* ``&`` - ``INTERSECT``
* ``-`` - ``EXCEPT``

Simple aggregation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You'd like to get the signup date of your last member. How can you retrieve
this information?

.. code-block:: sql

    SELECT MAX(join_date) FROM members;

.. code-block:: python

    query = Member.select(fn.MAX(Member.joindate))
    # To conveniently obtain a single scalar value, use "scalar()":
    # max_join_date = query.scalar()

More aggregation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You'd like to get the first and last name of the last member(s) who signed up
- not just the date.

.. code-block:: sql

    SELECT firstname, surname, joindate FROM members
    WHERE joindate = (SELECT MAX(joindate) FROM members);

.. code-block:: python

    # Use "alias()" to reference the same table multiple times in a query.
    MemberAlias = Member.alias()
    subq = MemberAlias.select(fn.MAX(MemberAlias.joindate))
    query = (Member
             .select(Member.firstname, Member.surname, Member.joindate)
             .where(Member.joindate == subq))


Joins and Subqueries
--------------------

This category deals primarily with a foundational concept in relational
database systems: joining. Joining allows you to combine related information
from multiple tables to answer a question. This isn't just beneficial for ease
of querying: a lack of join capability encourages denormalization of data,
which increases the complexity of keeping your data internally consistent.

This topic covers inner, outer, and self joins, as well as spending a little
time on subqueries (queries within queries).

Retrieve the start times of members' bookings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

How can you produce a list of the start times for bookings by members named
'David Farrell'?

.. code-block:: sql

    SELECT starttime FROM bookings
    INNER JOIN members ON (bookings.memid = members.memid)
    WHERE surname = 'Farrell' AND firstname = 'David';

.. code-block:: python

    query = (Booking
             .select(Booking.starttime)
             .join(Member)
             .where((Member.surname == 'Farrell') &
                    (Member.firstname == 'David')))


Work out the start times of bookings for tennis courts
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

How can you produce a list of the start times for bookings for tennis courts,
for the date '2012-09-21'? Return a list of start time and facility name
pairings, ordered by the time.

.. code-block:: sql

    SELECT starttime, name
    FROM bookings
    INNER JOIN facilities ON (bookings.facid = facilities.facid)
    WHERE date_trunc('day', starttime) = '2012-09-21':: date
      AND name ILIKE 'tennis%'
    ORDER BY starttime, name;

.. code-block:: python

    query = (Booking
             .select(Booking.starttime, Facility.name)
             .join(Facility)
             .where(
                 (fn.date_trunc('day', Booking.starttime) == datetime.date(2012, 9, 21)) &
                 Facility.name.startswith('Tennis'))
             .order_by(Booking.starttime, Facility.name))

    # To retrieve the joined facility's name when iterating:
    for booking in query:
        print(booking.starttime, booking.facility.name)


Produce a list of all members who have recommended another member
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

How can you output a list of all members who have recommended another member?
Ensure that there are no duplicates in the list, and that results are ordered
by (surname, firstname).

.. code-block:: sql

    SELECT DISTINCT m.firstname, m.surname
    FROM members AS m2
    INNER JOIN members AS m ON (m.memid = m2.recommendedby)
    ORDER BY m.surname, m.firstname;

.. code-block:: python

    MA = Member.alias()
    query = (Member
             .select(Member.firstname, Member.surname)
             .join(MA, on=(MA.recommendedby == Member.memid))
             .order_by(Member.surname, Member.firstname))


Produce a list of all members, along with their recommender
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

How can you output a list of all members, including the individual who
recommended them (if any)? Ensure that results are ordered by (surname,
firstname).

.. code-block:: sql

    SELECT m.firstname, m.surname, r.firstname, r.surname
    FROM members AS m
    LEFT OUTER JOIN members AS r ON (m.recommendedby = r.memid)
    ORDER BY m.surname, m.firstname

.. code-block:: python

    MA = Member.alias()
    query = (Member
             .select(Member.firstname, Member.surname, MA.firstname, MA.surname)
             .join(MA, JOIN.LEFT_OUTER, on=(Member.recommendedby == MA.memid))
             .order_by(Member.surname, Member.firstname))

    # To display the recommender's name when iterating:
    for m in query:
        print(m.firstname, m.surname)
        if m.recommendedby:
            print('  ', m.recommendedby.firstname, m.recommendedby.surname)


Produce a list of all members who have used a tennis court
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

How can you produce a list of all members who have used a tennis court?
Include in your output the name of the court, and the name of the member
formatted as a single column. Ensure no duplicate data, and order by the
member name.

.. code-block:: sql

    SELECT DISTINCT m.firstname || ' ' || m.surname AS member, f.name AS facility
    FROM members AS m
    INNER JOIN bookings AS b ON (m.memid = b.memid)
    INNER JOIN facilities AS f ON (b.facid = f.facid)
    WHERE f.name LIKE 'Tennis%'
    ORDER BY member, facility;

.. code-block:: python

    fullname = Member.firstname + ' ' + Member.surname
    query = (Member
             .select(fullname.alias('member'), Facility.name.alias('facility'))
             .join(Booking)
             .join(Facility)
             .where(Facility.name.startswith('Tennis'))
             .order_by(fullname, Facility.name)
             .distinct())


Produce a list of costly bookings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

How can you produce a list of bookings on the day of 2012-09-14 which will
cost the member (or guest) more than $30? Remember that guests have different
costs to members (the listed costs are per half-hour 'slot'), and the guest
user is always ID 0. Include in your output the name of the facility, the
name of the member formatted as a single column, and the cost. Order by
descending cost, and do not use any subqueries.

.. code-block:: sql

    SELECT m.firstname || ' ' || m.surname AS member,
           f.name AS facility,
           (CASE WHEN m.memid = 0 THEN f.guestcost * b.slots
            ELSE f.membercost * b.slots END) AS cost
    FROM members AS m
    INNER JOIN bookings AS b ON (m.memid = b.memid)
    INNER JOIN facilities AS f ON (b.facid = f.facid)
    WHERE (date_trunc('day', b.starttime) = '2012-09-14') AND
     ((m.memid = 0 AND b.slots * f.guestcost > 30) OR
      (m.memid > 0 AND b.slots * f.membercost > 30))
    ORDER BY cost DESC;

.. code-block:: python

    cost = Case(Member.memid, (
        (0, Booking.slots * Facility.guestcost),
    ), (Booking.slots * Facility.membercost))
    fullname = Member.firstname + ' ' + Member.surname

    query = (Member
             .select(fullname.alias('member'), Facility.name.alias('facility'),
                     cost.alias('cost'))
             .join(Booking)
             .join(Facility)
             .where(
                 (fn.date_trunc('day', Booking.starttime) == datetime.date(2012, 9, 14)) &
                 (cost > 30))
             .order_by(SQL('cost').desc()))

    # To iterate over the results, it might be easiest to use namedtuples:
    for row in query.namedtuples():
        print(row.member, row.facility, row.cost)


Produce a list of all members, along with their recommender, using no joins.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

How can you output a list of all members, including the individual who
recommended them (if any), without using any joins? Ensure that there are no
duplicates in the list, and that each firstname + surname pairing is
formatted as a column and ordered.

.. code-block:: sql

    SELECT DISTINCT m.firstname || ' ' || m.surname AS member,
       (SELECT r.firstname || ' ' || r.surname
        FROM cd.members AS r
        WHERE m.recommendedby = r.memid) AS recommended
    FROM members AS m ORDER BY member;

.. code-block:: python

    MA = Member.alias()
    subq = (MA
            .select(MA.firstname + ' ' + MA.surname)
            .where(Member.recommendedby == MA.memid))
    query = (Member
             .select(fullname.alias('member'), subq.alias('recommended'))
             .order_by(fullname))


Produce a list of costly bookings, using a subquery
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The "Produce a list of costly bookings" exercise contained some messy logic: we
had to calculate the booking cost in both the WHERE clause and the CASE
statement. Try to simplify this calculation using subqueries.

.. code-block:: sql

    SELECT member, facility, cost from (
      SELECT
      m.firstname || ' ' || m.surname as member,
      f.name as facility,
      CASE WHEN m.memid = 0 THEN b.slots * f.guestcost
      ELSE b.slots * f.membercost END AS cost
      FROM members AS m
      INNER JOIN bookings AS b ON m.memid = b.memid
      INNER JOIN facilities AS f ON b.facid = f.facid
      WHERE date_trunc('day', b.starttime) = '2012-09-14'
    ) as bookings
    WHERE cost > 30
    ORDER BY cost DESC;

.. code-block:: python

    cost = Case(Member.memid, (
        (0, Booking.slots * Facility.guestcost),
    ), (Booking.slots * Facility.membercost))

    iq = (Member
          .select(fullname.alias('member'), Facility.name.alias('facility'),
                  cost.alias('cost'))
          .join(Booking)
          .join(Facility)
          .where(fn.date_trunc('day', Booking.starttime) == datetime.date(2012, 9, 14)))

    query = (Member
             .select(iq.c.member, iq.c.facility, iq.c.cost)
             .from_(iq)
             .where(iq.c.cost > 30)
             .order_by(SQL('cost').desc()))

    # To iterate, try using dicts:
    for row in query.dicts():
        print(row['member'], row['facility'], row['cost'])


Modifying Data
--------------

Querying data is all well and good, but at some point you're probably going to
want to put data into your database! This section deals with inserting,
updating, and deleting information. Operations that alter your data like this
are collectively known as Data Manipulation Language, or DML.

In previous sections, we returned to you the results of the query you've
performed. Since modifications like the ones we're making in this section don't
return any query results, we instead show you the updated content of the table
you're supposed to be working on.

Insert some data into a table
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The club is adding a new facility - a spa. We need to add it into the
facilities table. Use the following values: facid: 9, Name: 'Spa',
membercost: 20, guestcost: 30, initialoutlay: 100000, monthlymaintenance: 800

.. code-block:: sql

    INSERT INTO "facilities" ("facid", "name", "membercost", "guestcost",
    "initialoutlay", "monthlymaintenance") VALUES (9, 'Spa', 20, 30, 100000, 800)

.. code-block:: python

    res = Facility.insert({
        Facility.facid: 9,
        Facility.name: 'Spa',
        Facility.membercost: 20,
        Facility.guestcost: 30,
        Facility.initialoutlay: 100000,
        Facility.monthlymaintenance: 800}).execute()

    # OR:
    res = (Facility
           .insert(facid=9, name='Spa', membercost=20, guestcost=30,
                   initialoutlay=100000, monthlymaintenance=800)
           .execute())


Insert multiple rows of data into a table
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the previous exercise, you learned how to add a facility. Now you're going
to add multiple facilities in one command. Use the following values:

facid: 9, Name: 'Spa', membercost: 20, guestcost: 30, initialoutlay: 100000,
monthlymaintenance: 800.

facid: 10, Name: 'Squash Court 2', membercost: 3.5, guestcost: 17.5,
initialoutlay: 5000, monthlymaintenance: 80.

.. code-block:: sql

    -- see above --

.. code-block:: python

    data = [
        {'facid': 9, 'name': 'Spa', 'membercost': 20, 'guestcost': 30,
         'initialoutlay': 100000, 'monthlymaintenance': 800},
        {'facid': 10, 'name': 'Squash Court 2', 'membercost': 3.5,
         'guestcost': 17.5, 'initialoutlay': 5000, 'monthlymaintenance': 80}]
    res = Facility.insert_many(data).execute()


Insert calculated data into a table
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Let's try adding the spa to the facilities table again. This time, though, we
want to automatically generate the value for the next facid, rather than
specifying it as a constant. Use the following values for everything else:
Name: 'Spa', membercost: 20, guestcost: 30, initialoutlay: 100000,
monthlymaintenance: 800.

.. code-block:: sql

    INSERT INTO "facilities" ("facid", "name", "membercost", "guestcost",
      "initialoutlay", "monthlymaintenance")
    SELECT (SELECT (MAX("facid") + 1) FROM "facilities") AS _,
            'Spa', 20, 30, 100000, 800;

.. code-block:: python

    maxq = Facility.select(fn.MAX(Facility.facid) + 1)
    subq = Select(columns=(maxq, 'Spa', 20, 30, 100000, 800))
    res = Facility.insert_from(subq, Facility._meta.sorted_fields).execute()

Update some existing data
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We made a mistake when entering the data for the second tennis court. The
initial outlay was 10000 rather than 8000: you need to alter the data to fix
the error.

.. code-block:: sql

    UPDATE facilities SET initialoutlay = 10000 WHERE name = 'Tennis Court 2';

.. code-block:: python

    res = (Facility
           .update({Facility.initialoutlay: 10000})
           .where(Facility.name == 'Tennis Court 2')
           .execute())

    # OR:
    res = (Facility
           .update(initialoutlay=10000)
           .where(Facility.name == 'Tennis Court 2')
           .execute())

Update multiple rows and columns at the same time
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We want to increase the price of the tennis courts for both members and
guests. Update the costs to be 6 for members, and 30 for guests.

.. code-block:: sql

    UPDATE facilities SET membercost=6, guestcost=30 WHERE name ILIKE 'Tennis%';

.. code-block:: python

    nrows = (Facility
             .update(membercost=6, guestcost=30)
             .where(Facility.name.startswith('Tennis'))
             .execute())

Update a row based on the contents of another row
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We want to alter the price of the second tennis court so that it costs 10%
more than the first one. Try to do this without using constant values for the
prices, so that we can reuse the statement if we want to.

.. code-block:: sql

    UPDATE facilities SET
    membercost = (SELECT membercost * 1.1 FROM facilities WHERE facid = 0),
    guestcost = (SELECT guestcost * 1.1 FROM facilities WHERE facid = 0)
    WHERE facid = 1;

Delete all bookings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As part of a clearout of our database, we want to delete all bookings from
the bookings table.

    DELETE FROM bookings;

.. code-block:: python

    nrows = Booking.delete().execute()


Delete a member from the cd.members table
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We want to remove member 37, who has never made a booking, from our database.

.. code-block:: python

    nrows = Member.delete().where(Member.memid == 37).execute()

Delete based on a subquery
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

How can we make that more general, to delete all members who have never made
a booking?

.. code-block:: sql

    DELETE FROM members WHERE NOT EXISTS (
      SELECT * FROM bookings WHERE bookings.memid = members.memid);

.. code-block:: python

    subq = Booking.select().where(Booking.member == Member.memid)
    nrows = Member.delete().where(~fn.EXISTS(subq)).execute()


Aggregation
-----------

Aggregation is one of those capabilities that really make you appreciate the
power of relational database systems. It allows you to move beyond merely
persisting your data, into the realm of asking truly interesting questions that
can be used to inform decision making. This category covers aggregation at
length, making use of standard grouping as well as more recent window
functions.

Count the number of facilities
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

simple. We want to know how many facilities exist - simply produce a total
count.

    # OR:
    count = Facility.select().count()

Count the number of expensive facilities
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Produce a count of the number of facilities that have a cost to guests of 10
or more.

.. code-block:: sql

    SELECT COUNT(facid) FROM facilities WHERE guestcost >= 10

.. code-block:: python

    query = Facility.select(fn.COUNT(Facility.facid)).where(Facility.guestcost >= 10)
    count = query.scalar()

    # OR:
    # count = Facility.select().where(Facility.guestcost >= 10).count()

Count the number of recommendations each member makes.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    ORDER BY recommendedby

.. code-block:: python

    query = (Member
             .select(Member.recommendedby, fn.COUNT(Member.memid))
             .where(Member.recommendedby.is_null(False))

Recursion
---------

Common Table Expressions allow us to, effectively, create our own temporary
tables for the duration of a query - they're largely a convenience to help us
make more readable SQL. Using the WITH RECURSIVE modifier, however, it's
possible for us to create recursive queries. This is enormously advantageous
for working with tree and graph-structured data - imagine retrieving all of the
relations of a graph node to a given depth, for example.

Find the upward recommendation chain for member ID 27
