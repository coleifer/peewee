## 3.9.3

* Added cross-database support for `NULLS FIRST/LAST` when specifying the
  ordering for a query. Previously this was only supported for Postgres. Peewee
  will now generate an equivalent `CASE` statement for Sqlite and MySQL.
* Added [EXCLUDED](http://docs.peewee-orm.com/en/latest/peewee/api.html#EXCLUDED)
  helper for referring to the `EXCLUDED` namespace used with `INSERT...ON CONFLICT`
  queries, when referencing values in the conflicting row data.
* Added helper method to the model `Metadata` class for setting the table name
  at run-time. Setting the `Model._meta.table_name` directly may have appeared
  to work in some situations, but could lead to subtle bugs. The new API is
  `Model._meta.set_table_name()`.
* Enhanced helpers for working with Peewee interactively, [see doc](http://docs.peewee-orm.com/en/latest/peewee/interactive.html).
* Fix cache invalidation bug in `DataSet` that was originally reported on the
  sqlite-web project.
* New example script implementing a [hexastore](https://github.com/coleifer/peewee/blob/master/examples/hexastore.py).

[View commits](https://github.com/coleifer/peewee/compare/3.9.0...3.9.2)

## 3.9.0

* Added new document describing how to [use peewee interactively](http://docs.peewee-orm.com/en/latest/peewee/interactive.html).
* Added convenience functions for generating model classes from a pre-existing
  database, printing model definitions and printing CREATE TABLE sql for a
  model. See the "use peewee interactively" section for details.
* Added a `__str__` implementation to all `Query` subclasses which converts the
  query to a string and interpolates the parameters.
* Improvements to `sqlite_ext.JSONField` regarding the serialization of data,
  as well as the addition of options to override the JSON serialization and
  de-serialization functions.
* Added `index_type` parameter to `Field`
* Added `DatabaseProxy`, which allows one to use database-specific decorators
  with an uninitialized `Proxy` object. See #1842 for discussion. Recommend
  that you update any usage of `Proxy` for deferring database initialization to
  use the new `DatabaseProxy` class instead.
* Added support for `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT` when the conflict target is a
  partial index (e.g., contains a `WHERE` clause). The `OnConflict` and
  `on_conflict()` APIs now take an additional `conflict_where` parameter to
  represent the `WHERE` clause of the partial index in question. See #1860.
* Enhanced the `playhouse.kv` extension to use efficient upsert for *all*
  database engines. Previously upsert was only supported for sqlite and mysql.
* Re-added the `orwhere()` query filtering method, which will append the given
  expressions using `OR` instead of `AND`. See #391 for old discussion.
* Added some new examples to the ``examples/`` directory
* Added `select_from()` API for wrapping a query and selecting one or more
  columns from the wrapped subquery. [Docs](http://docs.peewee-orm.com/en/latest/peewee/api.html#SelectQuery.select_from).
* Added documentation on using [row values](http://docs.peewee-orm.com/en/latest/peewee/query_operators.html#row-values).
* Removed the (defunct) "speedups" C extension, which as of 3.8.2 only
  contained a barely-faster function for quoting entities.

**Bugfixes**

* Fix bug in SQL generation when there was a subquery that used a common table
  expressions.
* Enhanced `prefetch()` and fixed bug that could occur when mixing
  self-referential foreign-keys and model aliases.
* MariaDB 10.3.3 introduces backwards-incompatible changes to the SQL used for
  upsert. Peewee now introspects the MySQL server version at connection time to
  ensure proper handling of version-specific features. See #1834 for details.
* Fixed bug where `TimestampField` would treat zero values as `None` when
  reading from the database.

## 3.8.2

**Backwards-incompatible changes**

* The default row-type for `INSERT` queries executed with a non-default
  `RETURNING` clause has changed from `tuple` to `Model` instances. This makes
  `INSERT` behavior consistent with `UPDATE` and `DELETE` queries that specify
  a `RETURNING` clause. To revert back to the old behavior, just append a call
  to `.tuples()` to your `INSERT ... RETURNING` query.
* Removing support for the `table_alias` model `Meta` option. Previously, this
  attribute could be used to specify a "vanity" alias for a model class in the
  generated SQL. As a result of some changes to support more robust UPDATE and
  DELETE queries, supporting this feature will require some re-working. As of
  the 3.8.0 release, it was broken and resulted in incorrect SQL for UPDATE
  queries, so now it is removed.

**New features**

* Added `playhouse.shortcuts.ReconnectMixin`, which can be used to implement
  automatic reconnect under certain error conditions (notably the MySQL error
  2006 - server has gone away).

**Bugfixes**

* Fix SQL generation bug when using an inline window function in the `ORDER BY`
  clause of a query.
* Fix possible zero-division in user-defined implementation of BM25 ranking
  algorithm for SQLite full-text search.

[View commits](https://github.com/coleifer/peewee/compare/3.8.1...3.8.2)

## 3.8.1

**New features**

* Sqlite `SearchField` now supports the `match()` operator, allowing full-text
  search to be performed on a single column (as opposed to the whole table).

**Changes**

* Remove minimum passphrase restrictions in SQLCipher integration.

**Bugfixes**

* Support inheritance of `ManyToManyField` instances.
* Ensure operator overloads are invoked when generating filter expressions.
* Fix incorrect scoring in Sqlite BM25, BM25f and Lucene ranking algorithms.
* Support string field-names in data dictionary when performing an ON CONFLICT
  ... UPDATE query, which allows field-specific conversions to be applied.
  References #1815.

## 3.8.0

**New features**

* Postgres `BinaryJSONField` now supports `has_key()`, `concat()` and
  `remove()` methods (though remove may require pg10+).
* Add `python_value()` method to the SQL-function helper `fn`, to allow
  specifying a custom function for mapping database values to Python values.

**Changes**

* Better support for UPDATE ... FROM queries, and more generally, more robust
  support for UPDATE and RETURNING clauses. This means that the
  `QualifiedNames` helper is no longer needed for certain types of queries.
* The `SqlCipherDatabase` no longer accepts a `kdf_iter` parameter. To
  configure the various SQLCipher encryption settings, specify the setting
  values as `pragmas` when initializing the database.
* Introspection will now, by default, only strip "_id" from introspected column
  names if those columns are foreign-keys. See #1799 for discussion.
* Allow `UUIDField` and `BinaryUUIDField` to accept hexadecimal UUID strings as
  well as raw binary UUID bytestrings (in addition to `UUID` instances, which
  are already supported).
* Allow `ForeignKeyField` to be created without an index.
* Allow multiple calls to `cast()` to be chained (#1795).
* Add logic to ensure foreign-key constraint names that exceed 64 characters
  are truncated using the same logic as is currently in place for long indexes.
* `ManyToManyField` supports foreign-keys to fields other than primary-keys.
* When linked against SQLite 3.26 or newer, support `SQLITE_CONSTRAINT` to
  designate invalid queries against virtual tables.
* SQL-generation changes to aid in supporting using queries within expressions
  following the SELECT statement.

**Bugfixes**

* Fixed bug in `order_by_extend()`, thanks @nhatHero.
* Fixed bug where the `DataSet` CSV import/export did not support non-ASCII
  characters in Python 3.x.
* Fixed bug where `model_to_dict` would attempt to traverse explicitly disabled
  foreign-key backrefs (#1785).
* Fixed bug when attempting to migrate SQLite tables that have a field whose
  column-name begins with "primary_".
* Fixed bug with inheriting deferred foreign-keys.

## 3.7.1

**New features**

* Added `table_settings` model `Meta` option, which should be a list of strings
  specifying additional options for `CREATE TABLE`, which are placed *after*
  the closing parentheses.
* Allow specification of `on_update` and `on_delete` behavior for many-to-many
  relationships when using `ManyToManyField`.

**Bugfixes**

* Fixed incorrect SQL generation for Postgresql ON CONFLICT clause when the
  conflict_target is a named constraint (rather than an index expression). This
  introduces a new keyword-argument to the `on_conflict()` method:
  `conflict_constraint`, which is currently only supported by Postgresql. Refs
  issue #1737.
* Fixed incorrect SQL for sub-selects used on the right side of `IN`
  expressions. Previously the query would be assigned an alias, even though an
  alias was not needed.
* Fixed incorrect SQL generation for Model indexes which contain SQL functions
  as indexed columns.
* Fixed bug in the generation of special queries used to perform operations on
  SQLite FTS5 virtual tables.
* Allow `frozenset` to be correctly parameterized as a list of values.
* Allow multi-value INSERT queries to specify `columns` as a list of strings.
* Support `CROSS JOIN` for model select queries.

## 3.7.0

**Backwards-incompatible changes**

* Pool database `close_all()` method renamed to `close_idle()` to better
  reflect the actual behavior.
* Databases will now raise `InterfaceError` when `connect()` or `close()` are
  called on an uninitialized, deferred database object.

**New features**

* Add methods to the migrations extension to support adding and dropping table
  constraints.
* Add [Model.bulk_create()](http://docs.peewee-orm.com/en/latest/peewee/api.html#Model.bulk_create)
  method for bulk-inserting unsaved model instances.
* Add `close_stale()` method to the connection pool to support closing stale
  connections.
* The `FlaskDB` class in `playhouse.flask_utils` now accepts a `model_class`
  parameter, which can be used to specify a custom base-class for models.

**Bugfixes**

* Parentheses were not added to subqueries used in function calls with more
  than one argument.
* Fixed bug when attempting to serialize many-to-many fields which were created
  initially with a `DeferredThroughModel`, see #1708.
* Fixed bug when using the Postgres `ArrayField` with an array of `BlobField`.
* Allow `Proxy` databases to be used as a context-manager.
* Fixed bug where the APSW driver was referring to the SQLite version from the
  standard library `sqlite3` driver, rather than from `apsw`.
* Reflection library attempts to wrap server-side column defaults in quotation
  marks if the column data-type is text/varchar.
* Missing import in migrations library, which would cause errors when
  attempting to add indexes whose name exceeded 64 chars.
* When using the Postgres connection pool, ensure any open/pending transactions
  are rolled-back when the connection is recycled.
* Even *more* changes to the `setup.py` script. In this case I've added a
  helper function which will reliably determine if the SQLite3 extensions can
  be built. This follows the approach taken by the Python YAML package.

[View commits](https://github.com/coleifer/peewee/compare/3.6.4...3.7.0)

## 3.6.4

Take a whole new approach, following what `simplejson` does. Allow the
`build_ext` command class to fail, and retry without extensions in the event we
run into issues building extensions. References #1676.

[View commits](https://github.com/coleifer/peewee/compare/3.6.3...3.6.4)

## 3.6.3

Add check in `setup.py` to determine if a C compiler is available before
building C extensions. References #1676.

[View commits](https://github.com/coleifer/peewee/compare/3.6.2...3.6.3)

## 3.6.2

Use `ctypes.util.find_library` to determine if `libsqlite3` is installed.
Should fix problems people are encountering installing when SQLite3 is not
available.

[View commits](https://github.com/coleifer/peewee/compare/3.6.1...3.6.2)

## 3.6.1

Fixed issue with setup script.

[View commits](https://github.com/coleifer/peewee/compare/3.6.0...3.6.1)

## 3.6.0

* Support for Python 3.7, including bugfixes related to new StopIteration
  handling inside of generators.
* Support for specifying `ROWS` or `RANGE` window frame types. For more
  information, see the new [frame type documentation](http://docs.peewee-orm.com/en/latest/peewee/querying.html#frame-types-range-vs-rows).
* Add APIs for user-defined window functions if using [pysqlite3](https://github.com/coleifer/pysqlite3)
  and sqlite 3.25.0 or newer.
* `TimestampField` now uses 64-bit integer data-type for storage.
* Added support to `pwiz` and `playhouse.reflection` to enable generating
  models from VIEWs.
* Added lower-level database API for introspecting VIEWs.
* Revamped continuous integration setup for better coverage, including 3.7 and
  3.8-dev.
* Allow building C extensions even if Cython is not installed, by distributing
  pre-generated C source files.
* Switch to using `setuptools` for packaging.

## 3.5.2

* New guide to using [window functions in Peewee](http://docs.peewee-orm.com/en/latest/peewee/querying.html#window-functions).
* New and improved table name auto-generation. This feature is not backwards
  compatible, so it is **disabled by default**. To enable, set
  `legacy_table_names=False` in your model's `Meta` options. For more details,
  see [table names](http://docs.peewee-orm.com/en/latest/peewee/models.html#table_names)
  documentation.
* Allow passing single fields/columns to window function `order_by` and
  `partition_by` arguments.
* Support for `FILTER (WHERE...)` clauses with window functions and aggregates.
* Added `IdentityField` class suitable for use with Postgres 10's new identity
  column type. It can be used anywhere `AutoField` or `BigAutoField` was being
  used previously.
* Fixed bug creating indexes on tables that are in attached databases (SQLite).
* Fixed obscure bug when using `prefetch()` and `ModelAlias` to populate a
  back-reference related model.

[View commits](https://github.com/coleifer/peewee/compare/3.5.1...3.5.2)

## 3.5.1

**New features**

* New documentation for working with [relationships](http://docs.peewee-orm.com/en/latest/peewee/relationships.html)
  in Peewee.
* Improved tests and documentation for MySQL upsert functionality.
* Allow `database` parameter to be specified with `ModelSelect.get()` method.
  For discussion, see #1620.
* Add `QualifiedNames` helper to peewee module exports.
* Add `temporary=` meta option to support temporary tables.
* Allow a `Database` object to be passed to constructor of `DataSet` helper.

**Bug fixes**

* Fixed edge-case where attempting to alias a field to it's underlying
  column-name (when different), Peewee would not respect the alias and use the
  field name instead. See #1625 for details and discussion.
* Raise a `ValueError` when joining and aliasing the join to a foreign-key's
  `object_id_name` descriptor. Should prevent accidentally introducing O(n)
  queries or silently ignoring data from a joined-instance.
* Fixed bug for MySQL when creating a foreign-key to a model which used the
  `BigAutoField` for it's primary-key.
* Fixed bugs in the implementation of user-defined aggregates and extensions
  with the APSW SQLite driver.
* Fixed regression introduced in 3.5.0 which ignored custom Model `__repr__()`.
* Fixed regression from 2.x in which inserting from a query using a `SQL()` was
  no longer working. Refs #1645.

[View commits](https://github.com/coleifer/peewee/compare/3.5.0...3.5.1)

## 3.5.0

**Backwards-incompatible changes**

* Custom Model `repr` no longer use the convention of overriding `__unicode__`,
  and now use `__str__`.
* Redesigned the [sqlite json1 integration](http://docs.peewee-orm.com/en/latest/peewee/sqlite_ext.html#sqlite-json1).
  and changed some of the APIs and semantics of various `JSONField` methods.
  The documentation has been expanded to include more examples and the API has
  been simplified to make it easier to work with. These changes **do not** have
  any effect on the [Postgresql JSON fields](http://docs.peewee-orm.com/en/latest/peewee/playhouse.html#pgjson).

**New features**

* Better default `repr` for model classes and fields.
* `ForeignKeyField()` accepts a new initialization parameter, `deferrable`, for
  specifying when constraints should be enforced.
* `BitField.flag()` can be called without a value parameter for the common
  use-case of using flags that are powers-of-2.
* `SqliteDatabase` pragmas can be specified as a `dict` (previously required a
  list of 2-tuples).
* SQLite `TableFunction` ([docs](http://docs.peewee-orm.com/en/latest/peewee/sqlite_ext.html#sqlite-vtfunc))
  will print Python exception tracebacks raised in the `initialize` and
  `iterate` callbacks, making debugging significantly easier.

**Bug fixes**

* Fixed bug in `migrator.add_column()` where, if the field being added declared
  a non-standard index type (e.g., binary json field with GIN index), this
  index type was not being respected.
* Fixed bug in `database.table_exists()` where the implementation did not match
  the documentation. Implementation has been updated to match the
  documentation.
* Fixed bug in SQLite `TableFunction` implementation which raised errors if the
  return value of the `iterate()` method was not a `tuple`.

## 3.4.0

**Backwards-incompatible changes**

* The `regexp()` operation is now case-sensitive for MySQL and Postgres. To
  perform case-insensitive regexp operations, use `iregexp()`.
* The SQLite `BareField()` field-type now supports all column constraints
  *except* specifying the data-type. Previously it silently ignored any column
  constraints.
* LIMIT and OFFSET parameters are now treated as parameterized values instead
  of literals.
* The `schema` parameter for SQLite database introspection methods is no longer
  ignored by default. The schema corresponds to the name given to an attached
  database.
* `ArrayField` now accepts a new parameter `field_kwargs`, which is used to
  pass information to the array field's `field_class` initializer.

**New features and other changes**

* SQLite backup interface supports specifying page-counts and a user-defined
  progress handler.
* GIL is released when doing backups or during SQLite busy timeouts (when using
  the peewee SQLite busy-handler).
* Add NATURAL join-type to the `JOIN` helper.
* Improved identifier quoting to allow specifying distinct open/close-quote
  characters. Enables adding support for MSSQL, for instance, which uses square
  brackets, e.g. `[table].[column]`.
* Unify timeout interfaces for SQLite databases (use seconds everywhere rather
  than mixing seconds and milliseconds, which was confusing).
* Added `attach()` and `detach()` methods to SQLite database, making it
  possible to attach additional databases (e.g. an in-memory cache db).

[View commits](https://github.com/coleifer/peewee/compare/3.3.4...3.4.0)

## 3.3.4

* Added a `BinaryUUIDField` class for efficiently storing UUIDs in 16-bytes.
* Fix dataset's `update_cache()` logic so that when updating a single table
  that was newly-added, we also ensure that all dependent tables are updated at
  the same time. Refs coleifer/sqlite-web#42.

[View commits](https://github.com/coleifer/peewee/compare/3.3.3...3.3.4)

## 3.3.3

* More efficient implementation of model dependency-graph generation. Improves
  performance of recursively deleting related objects by omitting unnecessary
  subqueries.
* Added `union()`, `union_all()`, `intersect()` and `except_()` to the
  `Model`-specific query implementations. This was an oversight that should
  have been patched in 3.3.2, but is fixed in 3.3.3.
* Major cleanup to test runner and standardized test skipping logic to
  integrate with standard-library `unittest` conventions.

[View commits](https://github.com/coleifer/peewee/compare/3.3.2...3.3.3)

## 3.3.2

* Add methods for `union()`, `union_all`, `intersect()` and `except_()`.
  Previously, these methods were only available as operator overloads.
* Removed some Python 2.6-specific support code, as 2.6 is no longer officially
  supported.
* Fixed model-graph resolution logic for deferred foreign-keys.
* Better support for UPDATE...FROM queries (Postgresql).

[View commits](https://github.com/coleifer/peewee/compare/3.3.1...3.3.2)

## 3.3.1

* Fixed long-standing bug in 3.x regarding using column aliases with queries
  that utilize the ModelCursorWrapper (typically queries with one or more
  joins).
* Fix typo in model metadata code, thanks @klen.
* Add examples of using recursive CTEs to docs.

[View commits](https://github.com/coleifer/peewee/compare/3.3.0...3.3.1)

## 3.3.0

* Added support for SQLite's new `ON CONFLICT` clause, which is modelled on the
  syntax used by Postgresql and will be available in SQLite 3.24.0 and onward.
* Added better support for using common table expressions and a cleaner way of
  implementing recursive CTEs, both of which are also tested with integration
  tests (as opposed to just checking the generated SQL).
* Modernized the CI environment to utilize the latest MariaDB features, so we
  can test window functions and CTEs with MySQL (when available).
* Reorganized and unified the feature-flags in the test suite.

[View commits](https://github.com/coleifer/peewee/compare/3.2.5...3.3.0)

## 3.2.5

* Added `ValuesList` for representing values lists. [Docs](http://docs.peewee-orm.com/en/latest/peewee/api.html#ValuesList).
* `DateTimeField`, `DateField` and `TimeField` will parse formatted-strings
  before sending to the database. Previously this only occurred when reading
  values from the database.

[View commits](https://github.com/coleifer/peewee/compare/3.2.4...3.2.5)

## 3.2.4

* Smarter handling of model-graph when dealing with compound queries (union,
  intersect, etc). #1579.
* If the same column-name is selected multiple times, first value wins. #1579.
* If `ModelSelect.switch()` is called without any arguments, default to the
  query's model. Refs #1573.
* Fix issue where cloning a ModelSelect query did not result in the joins being
  cloned. #1576.

[View commits](https://github.com/coleifer/peewee/compare/3.2.3...3.2.4)

## 3.2.3

* `pwiz` tool will capture column defaults defined as part of the table schema.
* Fixed a misleading error message - #1563.
* Ensure `reuse_if_open` parameter has effect on pooled databases.
* Added support for on update/delete when migrating foreign-key.
* Fixed bug in SQL generation for subqueries in aliased functions #1572.

[View commits](https://github.com/coleifer/peewee/compare/3.2.2...3.2.3)

## 3.2.2

* Added support for passing `Model` classes to the `returning()` method when
  you intend to return all columns for the given model.
* Fixed a bug when using user-defined sequences, and the underlying sequence
  already exists.
* Added `drop_sequences` parameter to `drop_table()` method which allows you to
  conditionally drop any user-defined sequences when dropping the table.

[View commits](https://github.com/coleifer/peewee/compare/3.2.1...3.2.2)

## 3.2.1

**Notice:** the default mysql driver for Peewee has changed to [pymysql](https://github.com/PyMySQL/PyMySQL)
in version 3.2.1. In previous versions, if both *mysql-python* and *pymysql*
were installed, Peewee would use *mysql-python*. As of 3.2.1, if both libraries
are installed Peewee will use *pymysql*.

* Added new module `playhouse.mysql_ext` which includes
  `MySQLConnectorDatabase`, a database implementation that works with the
  [mysql-connector](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/connector-python/en/) driver.
* Added new field to `ColumnMetadata` class which captures a database column's
  default value. `ColumnMetadata` is returned by `Database.get_columns()`.
* Added [documentation on making Peewee async](http://docs.peewee-orm.com/en/latest/peewee/database.html#async-with-gevent).

[View commits](https://github.com/coleifer/peewee/compare/3.2.0...3.2.1)

## 3.2.0

The 3.2.0 release introduces a potentially backwards-incompatible change. The
only users affected will be those that have implemented custom `Field` types
with a user-defined `coerce` method. tl/dr: rename the coerce attribute to
adapt and you should be set.

#### Field.coerce renamed to Field.adapt

The `Field.coerce` method has been renamed to `Field.adapt`. The purpose of
this method is to convert a value from the application/database into the
appropriate Python data-type. For instance, `IntegerField.adapt` is simply the
`int` built-in function.

The motivation for this change is to support adding metadata to any AST node
instructing Peewee to not coerce the associated value. As an example, consider
this code:

```python

class Note(Model):
    id = AutoField()  # autoincrementing integer primary key.
    content = TextField()

# Query notes table and cast the "id" to a string and store as "id_text" attr.
query = Note.select(Note.id.cast('TEXT').alias('id_text'), Note.content)

a_note = query.get()
print((a_note.id_text, a_note.content))

# Prior to 3.2.0 the CAST is "un-done" because the value gets converted
# back to an integer, since the value is associated with the Note.id field:
(1, u'some note')  # 3.1.7, e.g. -- "id_text" is an integer!

# As of 3.2.0, CAST will automatically prevent the conversion of field values,
# which is an extension of a more general metadata API that can instruct Peewee
# not to convert certain values.
(u'1', u'some note')  # 3.2.0 -- "id_text" is a string as expected.
```

If you have implemented custom `Field` classes and are using `coerce` to
enforce a particular data-type, you can simply rename the attribute to `adapt`.

#### Other changes

Old versions of SQLite do not strip quotation marks from aliased column names
in compound queries (e.g. UNION). Fixed in 3.2.0.

[View commits](https://github.com/coleifer/peewee/compare/3.1.7...3.2.0)

## 3.1.7

For all the winblows lusers out there, added an option to skip compilation of
the SQLite C extensions during installation. Set env var `NO_SQLITE=1` and run
`setup.py install` and you should be able to build without requiring SQLite.

[View commits](https://github.com/coleifer/peewee/compare/3.1.6...3.1.7)

## 3.1.6

* Added `rekey()` method to SqlCipher database for changing encryption key and
  documentation for `set_passphrase()` method.
* Added `convert_values` parameter to `ArrayField` constructor, which will
  cause the array values to be processed using the underlying data-type's
  conversion logic.
* Fixed unreported bug using `TimestampField` with sub-second resolutions.
* Fixed bug where options were not being processed when calling `drop_table()`.
* Some fixes and improvements to `signals` extension.

[View commits](https://github.com/coleifer/peewee/compare/3.1.5...3.1.6)

## 3.1.5

Fixed Python 2/3 incompatibility with `itertools.izip_longest()`.

[View commits](https://github.com/coleifer/peewee/compare/3.1.4...3.1.5)

## 3.1.4

* Added `BigAutoField` to support 64-bit auto-incrementing primary keys.
* Use Peewee-compatible datetime serialization when exporting JSON from
  a `DataSet`. Previously the JSON export used ISO-8601 by default. See #1536.
* Added `Database.batch_commit` helper to wrap iterators in chunked
  transactions. See #1539 for discussion.

## 3.1.2

#### New behavior for INSERT queries with RETURNING clause

Investigating #1522, it occurred to me that INSERT queries with non-default
*RETURNING* clauses (postgres-only feature) should always return a cursor
object. Previously, if executing a single-row INSERT query, the last-inserted
row ID would be returned, regardless of what was specified by the RETURNING
clause.

This change only affects INSERT queries with non-default RETURNING clauses and
will cause a cursor to be returned, as opposed to the last-inserted row ID.

## 3.1.1

* Fixed bug when using `Model.alias()` when the model defined a particular
  database schema.
* Added `SchemaManager.create_foreign_key` API to simplify adding constraints
  when dealing with circular foreign-key relationships. Updated docs
  accordingly.
* Improved implementation of `Migrator.add_foreign_key_constraint` so that it
  can be used with Postgresql (in addition to MySQL).
* Added `PickleField` to the `playhouse.fields` module. [Docs](http://docs.peewee-orm.com/en/latest/peewee/playhouse.html#PickleField).
* Fixed bug in implementation of `CompressedField` when using Python 3.
* Added `KeyValue` API in `playhouse.kv` module. [Docs](http://docs.peewee-orm.com/en/latest/peewee/playhouse.html#key-value-store).
* More test cases for joining on sub-selects or common table expressions.

## 3.1.0

#### Backwards-incompatible changes

`Database.bind()` has been renamed to `Database.bind_ctx()`, to more closely
match the semantics of the corresponding model methods, `Model.bind()` and
`Model.bind_ctx()`. The new `Database.bind()` method is a one-time operation
that binds the given models to the database. See documentation:

* [Database.bind()](http://docs.peewee-orm.com/en/latest/peewee/api.html#Database.bind)
* [Database.bind_ctx()](http://docs.peewee-orm.com/en/latest/peewee/api.html#Database.bind_ctx)

#### Other changes

* Removed Python 2.6 support code from a few places.
* Fixed example analytics app code to ensure hstore extension is registered.
* Small efficiency improvement to bloom filter.
* Removed "attention!" from *README*.

## 2.10.1

Removed `AESEncryptedField`.

[View commits](https://github.com/coleifer/peewee/compare/2.10.0...2.10.1)

## 2.10.0

The main change in this release is the removal of the `AESEncryptedField`,
which was included as part of the `playhouse.fields` extension. It was brought
to my attention that there was some serious potential for security
vulnerabilities. Rather than give users a false sense of security, I've decided
the best course of action is to remove the field.

* Remove the `playhouse.fields.AESEncryptedField` over security concerns
described in ticket #1264.
* Correctly resolve explicit table dependencies when creating tables, refs
  #1076. Thanks @maaaks.
* Implement not equals comparison for `CompositeKey`.

[View commits](https://github.com/coleifer/peewee/compare/2.9.2...2.10.0)

## 2.9.2

* Fixed significant bug in the `savepoint` commit/rollback implementation. Many
  thanks to @Syeberman for raising the issue. See #1225 for details.
* Added support for postgresql `INTERVAL` columns. The new `IntervalField` in
  the `postgres_ext` module is suitable for storing `datetime.timedelta`.
* Fixed bug where missing `sqlite3` library was causing other, unrelated
  libraries to throw errors when attempting to import.
* Added a `case_sensitive` parameter to the SQLite `REGEXP` function
  implementation. The default is `False`, to preserve backwards-compatibility.
* Fixed bug that caused tables not to be created when using the `dataset`
  extension. See #1213 for details.
* Modified `drop_table` to raise an exception if the user attempts to drop
  tables with `CASCADE` when the database backend does not support it.
* Fixed Python3 issue in the `AESEncryptedField`.
* Modified the behavior of string-typed fields to treat the addition operator
  as concatenation. See #1241 for details.

## 2.9.1

* Fixed #1218, where the use of `playhouse.flask_utils` was requiring the

* Fixed #1219 regarding the SQL generation for composite key sub-selects,
  joins, etc.

[View commits](https://github.com/coleifer/peewee/compare/2.9.0...2.9.1)

## 2.9.0

In this release there are two notable changes:

* The ``Model.create_or_get()`` method was removed. See the [documentation](http://docs.peewee-orm.com/en/latest/peewee/querying.html#create-or-get)
  for an example of the code one would write to replicate this functionality.
* The SQLite closure table extension gained support for many-to-many
  relationships thanks to a nice PR by @necoro. [Docs](http://docs.peewee-orm.com/en/latest/peewee/playhouse.html#ClosureTable).

[View commits](https://github.com/coleifer/peewee/compare/2.8.8...2.9.0)

## 2.8.8

This release contains a single important bugfix for a regression in specifying
the type of lock to use when opening a SQLite transaction.

[View commits](https://github.com/coleifer/peewee/compare/2.8.7...2.8.8)

## 2.8.7

This release contains numerous cleanups.

### Bugs fixed

* #1087 - Fixed a misuse of the iteration protocol in the `sqliteq` extension.
* Ensure that driver exceptions are wrapped when calling `commit` and
  `rollback`.
* #1096 - Fix representation of recursive foreign key relations when using the
  `model_to_dict` helper.
* #1126 - Allow `pskel` to be installed into `bin` directory.
* #1105 - Added a `Tuple()` type to Peewee to enable expressing arbitrary
  tuple expressions in SQL.
* #1133 - Fixed bug in the conversion of objects to `Decimal` instances in the
  `DecimalField`.
* Fixed an issue renaming a unique foreign key in MySQL.
* Remove the join predicate from CROSS JOINs.
* #1148 - Ensure indexes are created when a column is added using a schema
  migration.
* #1165 - Fix bug where the primary key was being overwritten in queries using
  the closure-table extension.

### New stuff

* Added properties to the `SqliteExtDatabase` to expose common `PRAGMA`
  settings. For example, to set the cache size to 4MB, `db.cache_size = 1000`.
* Clarified documentation on calling `commit()` or `rollback()` from within the
  scope of an atomic block. [See docs](http://docs.peewee-orm.com/en/latest/peewee/transactions.html#transactions).
* Allow table creation dependencies to be specified using new `depends_on` meta
  option. Refs #1076.
* Allow specification of the lock type used in SQLite transactions. Previously
  this behavior was only present in `playhouse.sqlite_ext.SqliteExtDatabase`,
  but it now exists in `peewee.SqliteDatabase`.
* Added support for `CROSS JOIN` expressions in select queries.
* Docs on how to implement [optimistic locking](http://docs.peewee-orm.com/en/latest/peewee/hacks.html#optimistic-locking).
* Documented optional dependencies.
* Generic support for specifying select queries as locking the selected rows
  `FOR X`, e.g. `FOR UPDATE` or `FOR SHARE`.
* Support for specifying the frame-of-reference in window queries, e.g.
  specifying `UNBOUNDED PRECEDING`, etc. [See docs](http://docs.peewee-orm.com/en/latest/peewee/api.html#Window).

### Backwards-incompatible changes

* As of 9e76c99, an `OperationalError` is raised if the user calls `connect()`
  on an already-open Database object. Previously, the existing connection would
  remain open and a new connection would overwrite it, making it impossible to
  close the previous connection. If you find this is causing breakage in your
  application, you can switch the `connect()` call to `get_conn()` which will
  only open a connection if necessary. The error **is** indicative of a real
  issue, though, so audit your code for places where you may be opening a
  connection without closing it (module-scope operations, e.g.).

## 2.8.6

This release was later removed due to containing a bug. See notes on 2.8.7.

## 2.8.5

This release contains two small bugfixes.

* #1081 - fixed the use of parentheses in compound queries on MySQL.
* Fixed some grossness in a helper function used by `prefetch` that was
  clearing out the `GROUP BY` and `HAVING` clauses of sub-queries.

[View commits](https://github.com/coleifer/peewee/compare/2.8.4...2.8.5)

## 2.8.4

This release contains bugfixes as well as a new playhouse extension module for
working with [SQLite in multi-threaded / concurrent environments](http://docs.peewee-orm.com/en/latest/peewee/playhouse.html#sqliteq).
The new module is called `playhouse.sqliteq` and it works by serializing
queries using a dedicated worker thread (or greenlet). The performance is quite
good, hopefully this proves useful to someone besides myself! You can learn
more by reading the [sqliteq documentation](http://docs.peewee-orm.com/en/latest/peewee/playhouse.html#sqliteq).

As a miscellaneous note, I did some major refactoring and cleanup in
`ExtQueryResultsWrapper` and it's corollary in the `speedups` module. The code
is much easier to read than before.

[View commits](https://github.com/coleifer/peewee/compare/2.8.3...2.8.4)

### Bugs fixed

* #1061 - @akrs patched a bug in `TimestampField` which affected the accuracy
  of sub-second timestamps (for resolution > 1).
* #1071, small python 3 fix.
* #1072, allow `DeferredRelation` to be used multiple times if there are
  multiple references to a given deferred model.
* #1073, fixed regression in the speedups module that caused SQL functions to
  always coerce return values, regardless of the `coerce` flag.
* #1083, another Python 3 issue - this time regarding the use of `exc.message`.

[View commits](https://github.com/coleifer/peewee/compare/2.8.3...2.8.4)

## 2.8.3

This release contains bugfixes and a small backwards-incompatible change to the
way foreign key `ObjectIdDescriptor` is named (issue #1050).

### Bugs fixed and general changes

* #1028 - allow the `ensure_join` method to accept `on` and `join_type`
  parameters. Thanks @paulbooth.
* #1032 - fix bug related to coercing model instances to database parameters
  when the model's primary key is a foreign key.
* #1035 - fix bug introduced in 2.8.2, where I had added some logic to try and
  restrict the base `Model` class from being treated as a "real" Model.
* #1039 - update documentation to clarify that lists *or tuples* are acceptable
  values when specifying SQLite `PRAGMA` statements.
* #1041 - PyPy user was unable to install Peewee. (Who in their right mind
  would *ever* use PyPy?!) Bug was fixed by removing the pre-generated C files
  from the distribution.
* #1043 - fix bug where the `speedups` C extension was not calling the correct
  model initialization method, resulting in model instances returned as results
  of a query having their `dirty` flag incorrectly set.
* #1048 - similar to #1043, add logic to ensure that fields with default values
  are considered dirty when instantiating the model.
* #1049 - update URL to [APSW](https://rogerbinns.github.io/apsw).
* Fixed unreported bug regarding `TimestampField` with zero values reporting
  the incorrect datetime.

### New stuff

* [djpeewee](http://docs.peewee-orm.com/en/latest/peewee/playhouse.html#djpeewee) extension
  module now works with Django 1.9.
* [TimestampField](http://docs.peewee-orm.com/en/latest/peewee/api.html#TimestampField)
  is now an officially documented field.
* #1050 - use the `db_column` of a `ForeignKeyField` for the name of the
  `ObjectIdDescriptor`, except when the `db_column` and field `name` are the
  same, in which case the ID descriptor will be named `<field_name>_id`.

[View commits](https://github.com/coleifer/peewee/compare/2.8.2...2.8.3)

## 2.8.2

This release contains mostly bug-fixes, clean-ups, and API enhancements.

### Bugs fixed and general cleanups

* #820 - fixed some bugs related to the Cython extension build process.
* #858 - allow blanks and perform type conversion when using the `db_url`
  extension
* #922 - ensure that `peewee.OperationalError` is raised consistently when
  using the `RetryOperationalError` mixin.
* #929 - ensure that `pwiz` will import the appropriate extensions when
  vendor-specific fields are used.
* #930 - ensure that `pwiz`-generated models containing `UnknownField`
  placeholders do not blow up when you instantiate them.
* #932 - correctly limit the length of automatically-generated index names.
* #933 - fixed bug where `BlobField` could not be used if it's parent model
  pointed to an uninitialized database `Proxy`.
* #935 - greater consistency with the conversion to Python data-types when
  performing aggregations, annotations, or calling `scalar()`.
* #939 - ensure the correct data-types are used when initializing a connection
  pool.
* #947 - fix bug where `Signal` subclasses were not returning rows affected on
  save.
* #951 - better warnings regarding C extension compilation, thanks @dhaase-de.
* #968 - fix bug where table names starting with numbers generated invalid
  table names when using `pwiz`.
* #971 - fix bug where parameter was not being used. Thanks @jberkel.
* #974 - fixed the way `SqliteExtDatabase` handles the automatic `rowid` (and
    `docid`) columns. Thanks for alerting me to the issue and providing a
    failing test case @jberkel.
* #976 - fix obscure bug relating to cloning foreign key fields twice.
* #981 - allow `set` instances to be used on the right-hand side of `IN` exprs.
* #983 - fix behavior where the default `id` primary key was inherited
  regardless. When users would inadvertently include it in their queries, it
  would use the table alias of it's parent class.
* #992 - add support for `db_column` in `djpeewee`
* #995 - fix the behavior of `truncate_date` with Postgresql. Thanks @Zverik.
* #1011 - correctly handle `bytes` wrapper used by `PasswordField` to `bytes`.
* #1012 - when selecting and joining on multiple models, do not create model
  instances when the foreign key is NULL.
* #1017 - do not coerce the return value of function calls to `COUNT` or `SUM`,
  since the python driver will already give us the right Python value.
* #1018 - use global state to resolve `DeferredRelations`, allowing for a nicer
  API. Thanks @brenguyen711.
* #1022 - attempt to avoid creating invalid Python when using `pwiz` with MySQL
  database columns containing spaces. Yes, fucking spaces.
* #1024 - fix bug in SQLite migrator which had a naive approach to fixing
  indexes.
* #1025 - explicitly check for `None` when determining if the database has been
  set on `ModelOptions`. Thanks @joeyespo.

### New stuff

* Added `TimestampField` for storing datetimes using integers. Greater than
  second delay is possible through exponentiation.
* Added `Database.drop_index()` method.
* Added a `max_depth` parameter to the `model_to_dict` function in
  the `playhouse.shortcuts` extension module.
* `SelectQuery.first()` function accepts a parameter `n` which
  applies a limit to the query and returns the first row. Previously the limit
  was not applied out of consideration for subsequent iterations, but I believe
  usage has shown that a limit is more desirable than reserving the option to
  iterate without a second query. The old behavior is preserved in the new
  `SelectQuery.peek()` method.
* `group_by()`, `order_by()`, `window()` now accept a keyward argument
  `extend`, which, when set to `True`, will append to the existing values
  rather than overwriting them.
* Query results support negative indexing.
* C sources are included now as part of the package. I *think* they should be
  able to compile for python 2 or 3, on linux or windows...but not positive.
* #895 - added the ability to query using the `<foreign_key>_id` attribute.
* #948 - added documentation about SQLite limits and how they affect
* #1009 - allow `DATABASE_URL` as a recognized parameter to the Flask config.
  `insert_many`.

This release includes a couple new field types and greatly improved C extension support for both speedups and SQLite enhancements. Also includes some work, suggested by @foxx, to remove some places where `Proxy` was used in favor of more obvious APIs.

### New features

* [travis-ci builds](http://travis-ci.org/coleifer/peewee/builds/) now include MySQL and Python 3.5. Dropped support for Python 3.2 and 3.3. Builds also will run the C-extension code.
* C extension speedups now enabled by default, includes faster implementations for `dict` and `tuple` `QueryResultWrapper` classes, faster date formatting, and a faster field and model sorting.
* C implementations of SQLite functions is now enabled by default. SQLite extension is now compatible with APSW and can be used in standalone form directly from Python. See [SqliteExtDatabase](http://docs.peewee-orm.com/en/latest/peewee/playhouse.html#SqliteExtDatabase) for more details.
* SQLite C extension now supports `murmurhash2`.
* `UUIDField` is now supported for SQLite and MySQL, using `text` and `varchar` respectively, thanks @foxx!
* Added `BinaryField`, thanks again, @foxx!
* Added `PickledField` to `playhouse.fields`.
* `ManyToManyField` now accepts a list of primary keys when adding or removing values from the through relationship.
* Added support for SQLite [table-valued functions](http://sqlite.org/vtab.html#tabfunc2) using the [sqlite-vtfunc library](https://github.com/coleifer/sqlite-vtfunc).
* Significantly simplified the build process for compiling the C extensions.

### Backwards-incompatible changes

* Instead of using a `Proxy` for defining circular foreign key relationships, you now need to use [DeferredRelation](http://docs.peewee-orm.com/en/latest/peewee/api.html#DeferredRelation).
* Instead of using a `Proxy` for defining many-to-many through tables, you now need to use [DeferredThroughModel](http://docs.peewee-orm.com/en/latest/peewee/playhouse.html#DeferredThroughModel).
* SQLite Virtual Models must now use `Meta.extension_module` and `Meta.extension_options` to declare extension and any options. For more details, see [VirtualModel](http://docs.peewee-orm.com/en/latest/peewee/playhouse.html#VirtualModel).
* MySQL database will now issue `COMMIT` statements for `SELECT` queries. This was not necessary, but added due to an influx of confused users creating GitHub tickets. Hint: learn to user your damn database, it's not magic!

### Bugs fixed

Some of these may have been included in a previous release, but since I did not list them I'm listing them here.

* #766, fixed bug with PasswordField and Python3. Fuck Python 3.
* #768, fixed SortedFieldList and `remove_field()`. Thanks @klen!
* #771, clarified docs for APSW.
* #773, added docs for request hooks in Pyramid (who uses Pyramid, by the way?).
* #774, prefetch() only loads first ForeignKeyField for a given relation.
* #782, fixed typo in docs.
* #791, foreign keys were not correctly handling coercing to the appropriate python value.
* #792, cleaned up some CSV utils code.
* #798, cleaned up iteration protocol in QueryResultWrappers.
* #806, not really a bug, but MySQL users were clowning around and needed help.

## 2.7.4

This is another small release which adds code to automatically build the SQLite C extension if `libsqlite` is available. The release also includes:

* Support for `UUIDField` with SQLite.
* Support for registering additional database classes with the `db_url` module via `register_database`.
* `prefetch()` supports fetching multiple foreign-keys to the same model class.
* Added method to validate FTS5 search queries.

## 2.7.3

Small release which includes some changes to the BM25 sorting algorithm and the addition of a [`JSONField`](http://docs.peewee-orm.com/en/latest/peewee/playhouse.html#JSONField) for use with the new [JSON1 extension](http://sqlite.org/json1.html).

## 2.7.2

People were having trouble building the sqlite extension. I figure enough people are having trouble that I made it a separate command: `python setup.py build_sqlite_ext`.

## 2.7.1

Jacked up the setup.py

## 2.7.0

New APIs, features, and performance improvements.

### Notable changes and new features

* [`PasswordField`](http://docs.peewee-orm.com/en/latest/peewee/playhouse.html#PasswordField) that uses the `bcrypt` module.
* Added new Model [`Meta.only_save_dirty`](http://docs.peewee-orm.com/en/latest/peewee/models.html#model-options-and-table-metadata) flag to, by default, only save fields that have been modified.
* Added support for [`upsert()`](http://docs.peewee-orm.com/en/latest/peewee/api.html#InsertQuery.upsert) on MySQL (in addition to SQLite).
* Implemented SQLite ranking functions (``rank`` and ``bm25``) in Cython, and changed both the Cython and Python APIs to accept weight values for every column in the search index. This more closely aligns with the APIs provided by FTS5. In fact, made the APIs for FTS4 and FTS5 result ranking compatible.
* Major changes to the :ref:`sqlite_ext` module. Function callbacks implemented in Python were implemented in Cython (e.g. date manipulation and regex processing) and will be used if Cython is available when Peewee is installed.
* Support for the experimental new [FTS5](http://sqlite.org/fts5.html) SQLite search extension.
* Added :py:class:`SearchField` for use with the SQLite FTS extensions.
* Added :py:class:`RowIDField` for working with the special ``rowid`` column in SQLite.
* Added a model class validation hook to allow model subclasses to perform any validation after class construction. This is currently used to ensure that ``FTS5Model`` subclasses do not violate any rules required by the FTS5 virtual table.

### Bugs fixed

* **#751**, fixed some very broken behavior in the MySQL migrator code. Added more tests.
* **#718**, added a `RetryOperationalError` mixin that will try automatically reconnecting after a failed query. There was a bug in the previous error handler implementation that made this impossible, which is also fixed.

#### Small bugs

* #713, fix column name regular expression in SQLite migrator.
* #724, fixed `NULL` handling with the Postgresql `JSONField`.
* #725, added `__module__` attribute to `DoesNotExist` classes.
* #727, removed the `commit_select` logic for MySQL databases.
* #730, added documentation for `Meta.order_by` API.
* #745, added `cast()` method for casting JSON field values.
* #748, added docs and method override to indicate that SQLite does not support adding foreign key constraints after table creation.
* Check whether pysqlite or libsqlite were compiled with BerkeleyDB support when using the :py:class:`BerkeleyDatabase`.
* Clean up the options passed to SQLite virtual tables on creation.

### Small features

* #700, use sensible default if field's declared data-type is not present in the field type map.
* #707, allow model to be specified explicitly in `prefetch()`.
* #734, automatic testing against python 3.5.
* #753, added support for `upsert()` ith MySQL via the `REPLACE INTO ...` statement.
* #757, `pwiz`, the schema intropsection tool, will now generate multi-column index declarations.
* #756, `pwiz` will capture passwords using the `getpass()` function rather than via the command-line.
* Removed `Database.sql_error_handler()`, replaced with the `RetryOperationalError` mixin class.
* Documentation for `Meta.order_by` and `Meta.primary_key`.
* Better documentation around column and table constraints.
* Improved performance for some methods that are called frequently.
* Added `coerce` parameter to `BareField` and added documentation.

## 2.6.0

This is a tiny update, mainly consisting of a new-and-improved implementation of ``get_or_create()`` ([docs](http://docs.peewee-orm.com/en/latest/peewee/api.html#Model.get_or_create)).

### Backwards-incompatible changes

* ``get_or_create()`` now returns a 2-tuple consisting of the model instance and a boolean indicating whether the instance was created. The function now behaves just like the Django equivalent.

### New features

* #574, better support for setting the character encoding on Postgresql database connections. Thanks @klen!
* Improved implementation of [get_or_create()](http://docs.peewee-orm.com/en/latest/peewee/api.html#Model.get_or_create).

[View commits](https://github.com/coleifer/peewee/compare/2.5.1...2.6.0)

## 2.5.1

This is a relatively small release with a few important bugfixes.

### Bugs fixed

* #566, fixed a bug regarding parentheses around compound `SELECT` queries (i.e. `UNION`, `INTERSECT`, etc).
* Fixed unreported bug where table aliases were not generated correctly for compound `SELECT` queries.
* #559, add option to preserve original column order with `pwiz`. Thanks @elgow!
* Fixed unreported bug where selecting all columns from a `ModelAlias` does not use the appropriate `FieldAlias` objects.

### New features

* #561, added an option for bulk insert queries to return the list of auto-generated primary keys. See [docs for InsertQuery.return_id_list](http://docs.peewee-orm.com/en/latest/peewee/api.html#InsertQuery.return_id_list).
* #569, added `parse` function to the `playhouse.db_url` module. Thanks @stt!
* Added [hacks](http://docs.peewee-orm.com/en/latest/peewee/hacks.html) section to the docs. Please contribute your hacks!

### Backwards-incompatible changes

* Calls to `Node.in_()` and `Node.not_in()` do not take `*args` anymore and instead take a single argument.

[View commits](https://github.com/coleifer/peewee/compare/2.5.0...2.5.1)

## 2.5.0

There are a couple new features so I thought I'd bump to 2.5.x. One change Postgres users may be happy to see is the use of `INSERT ... RETURNING` to perform inserts. This should definitely speed up inserts for Postgres, since an extra query is no longer needed to get the new auto-generated primary key.

I also added a [new context manager/decorator](http://docs.peewee-orm.com/en/latest/peewee/database.html#using-multiple-databases) that allows you to use a different database for the duration of the wrapped block.

### Bugs fixed

* #534, CSV utils was erroneously stripping the primary key from CSV data.
* #537, fix upserts when using `insert_many`.
* #541, respect `autorollback` with `PostgresqlExtDatabase`. Thanks @davidmcclure.
* #551, fix for QueryResultWrapper's implementation of the iterator protocol.
* #554, allow SQLite journal_mode to be set at run-time.
* Fixed case-sensitivity issue with `DataSet`.

### New features

* Added support for [CAST expressions](http://docs.peewee-orm.com/en/latest/peewee/playhouse.html#cast).
* Added a hook for [extending Node](http://docs.peewee-orm.com/en/latest/peewee/api.html#Node.extend) with custom methods.
* `JOIN_<type>` became `JOIN.<type>`, e.g. `.join(JOIN.LEFT_OUTER)`.
* `OP_<code>` became `OP.<code>`.
* #556, allowed using `+` and `-` prefixes to indicate ascending/descending ordering.
* #550, added [Database.initialize_connection()](http://docs.peewee-orm.com/en/latest/peewee/database.html#additional-connection-initialization) hook.
* #549, bind selected columns to a particular model. Thanks @jhorman, nice PR!
* #531, support for swapping databases at run-time via [Using](http://docs.peewee-orm.com/en/latest/peewee/database.html#using-multiple-databases).
* #530, support for SQLCipher and Python3.
* New `RowIDField` for `sqlite_ext` playhouse module. This field can be used to interact with SQLite `rowid` fields.
* Added `LateralJoin` helper to the `postgres_ext` playhouse module.
* New [example blog app](https://github.com/coleifer/peewee/tree/master/examples/blog).

* #506, Fixed regression in `aggregate_rows()`
* #510, Fixes bug in pwiz overwriting columns.
* #514, Correctly cast foreign keys in `prefetch()`.
* #515, Simplifies queries issued when doing recursive deletes.
* #516, Fix cloning of Field objects.
* #519, Aggregate rows now correctly preserves ordering of joined instances.
* Unreported, fixed bug to not leave expired connections sitting around in the pool.

### New features

* Added support for Postgresql's ``jsonb`` type with [BinaryJSONField](http://docs.peewee-orm.com/en/latest/peewee/playhouse.html#BinaryJSONField).
* Add some basic [Flask helpers](http://docs.peewee-orm.com/en/latest/peewee/playhouse.html#flask-utils).
* Add support for `UNION ALL` queries in #512
* Add `SqlCipherExtDatabase`, which combines the sqlcipher database with the sqlite extensions.
* Add option to print metadata when generating code with ``pwiz``.

[View commits](https://github.com/coleifer/peewee/compare/2.4.6...2.4.7)

## 2.4.6

This is a relatively small release with mostly bug fixes and updates to the documentation. The one new feature I'd like to highlight is the ``ManyToManyField`` ([docs](http://docs.peewee-orm.com/en/latest/peewee/playhouse.html#ManyToManyField)).

### Bugs fixed

* #503, fixes behavior of `aggregate_rows()` when used with a `CompositeKey`.
* #498, fixes value coercion for field aliases.
* #492, fixes bug with pwiz and composite primary keys.
* #486, correctly handle schemas with reflection module.

### New features

* Peewee has a new [ManyToManyField](http://docs.peewee-orm.com/en/latest/peewee/playhouse.html#ManyToManyField) available in the ``playhouse.shortcuts`` module.
* Peewee now has proper support for *NOT IN* queries through the ``Node.not_in()`` method.
* Models now support iteration. This is equivalent to ``Model.select()``.

## 2.4.5

I'm excited about this release, as in addition to a number of new features and bugfixes, it also is a step towards cleaner code. I refactored the tests into a number of modules, using a standard set of base test-cases and helpers. I also introduced the `mock` library into the test suite and plan to use it for cleaner tests going forward. There's a lot of work to do to continue cleaning up the tests, but I'm feeling good about the changes. Curiously, the test suite runs faster now.

### Bugs fixed

* #471, #482 and #484, all of which had to do with how joins were handled by the `aggregate_rows()` query result wrapper.
* #472 removed some needless special-casing in `Model.save()`.
* #466 fixed case-sensitive issues with the SQLite migrator.
* #474 fixed a handful of bugs that cropped up migrating foreign keys with SQLite.
* #475 fixed the behavior of the SQLite migrator regarding auto-generated indexes.
* #479 fixed a bug in the code that stripped extra parentheses in the SQL generator.
* Fixed a handful of bugs in the APSW extension.

### New features

* Added connection abstraction called `ExecutionContext` ([see docs](http://docs.peewee-orm.com/en/latest/peewee/database.html#advanced-connection-management)).
* Made all context managers work as decorators (`atomic`, `transaction`, `savepoint`, `execution_context`).
* Added explicit methods for `IS NULL` and `IS NOT NULL` queries. The latter was actually necessary since the behavior is different from `NOT IS NULL (...)`.
* Allow disabling backref validation (#465)
* Made quite a few improvements to the documentation, particularly sections on transactions.
* Added caching to the [DataSet](http://docs.peewee-orm.com/en/latest/peewee/playhouse.html#dataset) extension, which should improve performance.
* Made the SQLite migrator smarter with regards to preserving indexes when a table copy is necessary.

## 2.4.4

Biggest news: peewee has a new logo!

![](http://media.charlesleifer.com/blog/photos/peewee-logo-bold.png)

* Small documentation updates here and there.

### Backwards-incompatible changes

* The argument signature for the `SqliteExtDatabase.aggregate()` decorator changed so that the aggregate name is the first parameter, and the number of parameters is the second parameter. If no values are specified, peewee will choose the name of the class and an un-specified number of arguments (`-1`).
* The logic for saving a model with a composite key changed slightly. Previously, if a model had a composite primary key and you called `save()`, only the dirty fields would be saved.

### Bugs fixed

* #462
* #465, add hook for disabling backref validation.
* #466, fix case-sensitive table names with migration module.
* #469, save only dirty fields.

### New features

* Lots of enhancements and cleanup to the `playhouse.apsw_ext` module.
* The `playhouse.reflection` module now supports introspecting indexes.
* Added a model option for disabling backref validation.
* Added support for the SQLite [closure table extension](http://charlesleifer.com/blog/querying-tree-structures-in-sqlite-using-python-and-the-transitive-closure-extension/).
* Added support for *virtual fields*, which act on dynamically-created virtual table fields.
* Added a new example: a virtual table implementation that exposes Redis as a relational database table.
* Added a module `playhouse.sqlite_aggregates` that contains a handful of aggregates you may find useful when developing with SQLite.

## 2.4.3

This release contains numerous improvements, particularly around the built-in database introspection utilities. Peewee should now also be compatible with PyPy.

### Bugs fixed

* #466, table names are case sensitive in the SQLite migrations module.
* #465, added option to disable backref validation.
* #462, use the schema name consistently with postgres reflection.

### New features

* New model *Meta* option to disable backref validation. [See validate_backrefs](http://docs.peewee-orm.com/en/latest/peewee/models.html#model-options-and-table-metadata).
* Added documentation on ordering by calculated values.
* Added basic PyPy compatibility.
* Added logic to close cursors after they have been exhausted.
* Structured and consolidated database metadata introspection, including improvements for introspecting indexes.
* Added support to [prefetch](http://docs.peewee-orm.com/en/latest/peewee/api.html?highlight=prefetch#prefetch) for traversing *up* the query tree.

## 2.4.2

This release contains a number of improvements to the `reflection` and `migrate` extension modules. I also added an encrypted *diary* app to the [examples](https://github.com/coleifer/peewee/tree/master/examples) directory.

### Bugs fixed

* #449, typo in the db_url extension, thanks to @malea for the fix.
* #457 and #458, fixed documentation deficiences.

### New features

* Added support for [importing data](http://docs.peewee-orm.com/en/latest/peewee/playhouse.html#importing-data) when using the [DataSet extension](http://docs.peewee-orm.com/en/latest/peewee/playhouse.html#dataset).
* Added an encrypted diary app to the examples.
* Better index reconstruction when altering columns on SQLite databases with the [migrate](http://docs.peewee-orm.com/en/latest/peewee/playhouse.html#migrate) module.
* Support for multi-column primary keys in the [reflection](http://docs.peewee-orm.com/en/latest/peewee/playhouse.html#reflection) module.

[View commits](https://github.com/coleifer/peewee/compare/2.4.1...2.4.2)

## 2.4.1

This release contains a few small bugfixes.

### Bugs fixed

* #448, add hook to the connection pool for detecting closed connections.
* #229, fix join attribute detection.
* #447, fixed documentation typo.

[View commits](https://github.com/coleifer/peewee/compare/2.4.0...2.4.1)

## 2.4.0

This release contains a number of enhancements to the `playhouse` collection of extensions.

### Backwards-incompatible changes

As of 2.4.0, most of the introspection logic was moved out of the ``pwiz`` module and into ``playhouse.reflection``.

### New features

* Created a new [reflection](http://docs.peewee-orm.com/en/latest/peewee/playhouse.html#reflection) extension for introspecting databases. The *reflection* module additionally can generate actual peewee Model classes dynamically.
* Created a [dataset](http://docs.peewee-orm.com/en/latest/peewee/playhouse.html#dataset) library (based on the [SQLAlchemy project](https://dataset.readthedocs.io/) of the same name). For more info check out the blog post [announcing playhouse.dataset](http://charlesleifer.com/blog/saturday-morning-hacks-dataset-for-peewee/).
* Added a [db_url](http://docs.peewee-orm.com/en/latest/peewee/playhouse.html#database-url) module which creates `Database` objects from a connection string.
* Added [csv dump](http://docs.peewee-orm.com/en/latest/peewee/playhouse.html#dumping-csv) functionality to the [CSV utils](http://docs.peewee-orm.com/en/latest/peewee/playhouse.html#csv-utils) extension.
* Added an [atomic](http://docs.peewee-orm.com/en/latest/peewee/transactions.html#nesting-transactions) context manager to support nested transactions.
* Added support for HStore, JSON and TSVector to the `reflection` module.
* More documentation updates.

### Bugs fixed

* Fixed #440, which fixes a bug where `Model.dirty_fields` did not return an empty set for some subclasses of `QueryResultWrapper`.

[View commits](https://github.com/coleifer/peewee/compare/2.3.3...2.4.0)

## 2.3.3

This release contains a lot of improvements to the documentation and a mixed bag of other new features and bugfixes.

### Backwards-incompatible changes

As of 2.3.3, all peewee `Database` instances have a default of `True` for the `threadlocals` parameter. This means that a connection is opened for each thread. It seemed to me that by sharing connections across threads caused a lot of confusion to users who weren't aware of (or familiar with) the `threadlocals` parameter. For single-threaded apps the behavior will not be affected, but for multi-threaded applications, if you wish to share your connection across threads you must now specify `threadlocals=False`. For more information, see the [documentation](http://docs.peewee-orm.com/en/latest/peewee/api.html#Database).

I also renamed the `Model.get_id()` and `Model.set_id()` convenience methods so as not to conflict with Flask-Login. These methods should have probably been private anyways, and the new methods are named `_get_pk_value()` and `_set_pk_value()`.

### New features

* Basic support for [Postgresql full-text search](http://docs.peewee-orm.com/en/latest/peewee/playhouse.html#pg-fts).
* Helper functions for converting models to dictionaries and unpacking dictionaries into model instances. See [docs](http://docs.peewee-orm.com/en/latest/peewee/playhouse.html#model_to_dict).

### Bugs fixed

* Fixed #428, documentation formatting error.
* Fixed #429, which fixes the way default values are initialized for bulk inserts.
* Fixed #432, making the HStore extension optional when using `PostgresqlExtDatabase`.
* Fixed #435, allowing peewee to be used with Flask-Login.
* Fixed #436, allowing the SQLite date_part and date_trunc functions to correctly handle NULL values.
* Fixed #438, in which the ordering of clauses in a Join expression were causing unpredictable behavior when selecting related instances.
* Updated the `berkeley_build.sh` script, which was incompatible with the newest version of `bsddb3`.

## 2.2.0

This release contains a large refactoring of the way SQL was generated for both
the standard query classes (`Select`, `Insert`, `Update`, `Delete`) as well as
for the DDL methods (`create_table`, `create_index`, etc). Instead of joining
strings of SQL and manually quoting things, I've created `Clause` objects
containing multiple `Node` objects to represent all parts of the query.

I also changed the way peewee determins the SQL to represent a field. Now a
field implements ``__ddl__`` and ``__ddl_column__`` methods. The former creates
the entire field definition, e.g.:

    "quoted_column_name" <result of call to __ddl_column__> [NOT NULL/PRIMARY KEY/DEFAULT NEXTVAL(...)/CONSTRAINTS...]

The latter method is responsible just for the column type definition. This might
return ``VARCHAR(255)`` or simply ``TEXT``. I've also added support for
arbitrary constraints on each field, so you might have:

    price = DecimalField(decimal_places=2, constraints=[Check('price > 0')])

### Changes in 2.2.0

* Refactored query generation for both SQL queries and DDL queries.
* Support for arbitrary column constraints.
* `autorollback` option to the `Database` class that will roll back the
  transaction before raising an exception.
* Added `JSONField` type to the `postgresql_ext` module.
* Track fields that are explicitly set, allowing faster saves (thanks @soasme).
* Allow the `FROM` clause to be an arbitrary `Node` object (#290).
* `schema` is a new `Model.Mketa` option and is used throughout the code.
* Allow indexing operation on HStore fields (thanks @zdxerr, #293).

### Bugs fixed

* #277 (where calls not chainable with update query)
* #278, use `wraps()`, thanks @lucasmarshall
* #284, call `prepared()` after `create()`, thanks @soasme.
* #286, cursor description issue with pwiz + postgres

## 2.1.7

### Changes in 2.1.7

* Support for savepoints (Sqlite, Postgresql and MySQL) using an API similar to that of transactions.
* Common set of exceptions to wrap DB-API 2 driver-specific exception classes, e.g. ``peewee.IntegrityError``.
* When pwiz cannot determine the underlying column type, display it in a comment in the generated code.
* Support for circular foreign-keys.
* Moved ``Proxy`` into peewee (previously in ``playhouse.proxy``).
* Renamed ``R()`` to ``SQL()``.
* General code cleanup, some new comments and docstrings.

### Bugs fixed

* Fixed a small bug in the way errors were handled in transaction context manager.
* #257
* #265, nest multiple calls to functions decorated with `@database.commit_on_success`.
* #266
* #267
