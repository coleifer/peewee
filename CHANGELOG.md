## 2.2.1

I've been looking forward to this release, as it contains a couple new features
that I've been wanting to add for some time now. Hope you find them useful.

### Changes in 2.2.1

* Window queries using ``OVER`` syntax.
* Compound query operations ``UNION``, ``INTERSECT``, ``EXCEPT`` as well as symmetric difference.

### Bugs fixed

* #300, pwiz was not correctly interpreting some foreign key constraints in SQLite.
* #298, drop table with cascade API was missing.
* #294, typo.

## 2.2.0

This release contains a large refactoring of the way SQL was generated for both
the standard query classes (`Select`, `Insert`, `Update`, `Delete`) as well as
for the DDL methods (`create_table`, `create_index`, etc). Instead of joining
strings of SQL and manually quoting things, I've created `Clause` objects
containing multiple `Node` objects to represent all parts of the query.

I also changed the way peewee determins the SQL to represent a field. Now a
field implements ``__ddl__`` and ``__ddl_column__`` methods. The former creates
the entire field definition, e.g.:

    "quoted_column_name" <result of call to __ddl_column__> [NOT NULL/PRIMARY KEY/DEFAULT NEXTVAL(...)/CONSTRAINTS...]

The latter method is responsible just for the column type definition. This might
return ``VARCHAR(255)`` or simply ``TEXT``. I've also added support for
arbitrary constraints on each field, so you might have:

    price = DecimalField(decimal_places=2, constraints=[Check('price > 0')])

### Changes in 2.2.0

* Refactored query generation for both SQL queries and DDL queries.
* Support for arbitrary column constraints.
* `autorollback` option to the `Database` class that will roll back the
  transaction before raising an exception.
* Added `JSONField` type to the `postgresql_ext` module.
* Track fields that are explicitly set, allowing faster saves (thanks @soasme).
* Allow the `FROM` clause to be an arbitrary `Node` object (#290).
* `schema` is a new `Model.Mketa` option and is used throughout the code.
* Allow indexing operation on HStore fields (thanks @zdxerr, #293).

### Bugs fixed

* #277 (where calls not chainable with update query)
* #278, use `wraps()`, thanks @lucasmarshall
* #284, call `prepared()` after `create()`, thanks @soasme.
* #286, cursor description issue with pwiz + postgres

## 2.1.7

### Changes in 2.1.7

* Support for savepoints (Sqlite, Postgresql and MySQL) using an API similar to that of transactions.
* Common set of exceptions to wrap DB-API 2 driver-specific exception classes, e.g. ``peewee.IntegrityError``.
* When pwiz cannot determine the underlying column type, display it in a comment in the generated code.
* Support for circular foreign-keys.
* Moved ``Proxy`` into peewee (previously in ``playhouse.proxy``).
* Renamed ``R()`` to ``SQL()``.
* General code cleanup, some new comments and docstrings.

### Bugs fixed

* Fixed a small bug in the way errors were handled in transaction context manager.
* #257
* #265, nest multiple calls to functions decorated with `@database.commit_on_success`.
* #266
* #267
